# About the Research Group

## Introduction

HPC-RG is the High-Performance Computing (HPC) research group at the University of Huddersfield. We are trying to promote the link between HPC users, developers and researchers across the University. Currently there are links between several small groups of researchers all requiring HPC in various ways. The formation of the group will enable sharing the expertise and resources between small research groups in varied areas of research, and practitioners each involved in HPC. It will provide the link between users and designers of the HPC systems.

## Aims
The group aims are:

- To encourage and develop HPC expertise within the departments across the university
- To foster mutually supportive environments for research active staff involved in HPC, by encouraging collaboration and increase the impact of HPC both within the university and further a field.
- To facilitate exchange of ideas and to disseminate cutting edge HPC knowledge via research seminars and conferences
- To provide an external reference point for communications with the wider community on HPC matters

## Scope

The initial areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

 - Grid and Cluster Computing architecture, middleware, tools
 - Cloud computing in academia
 - CAE, and FEA modelling
 - Application of Agent technology in Grid and Cloud resources management
 - Atomistic simulation of solids and interfaces, using combinations of molecular dynamics, lattice dynamics and plane wave density theory
 - Simulation of inorganic complexes using Gaussian density theory
 - Simulation of proteins using classical molecular dynamics

# Resource Centre
 
HPC-RC is the High Performance Computing (HPC) Resource Centre; A one-stop-shop for all things Cluster, Grid and Cloud on the Campus. We manage all HPC and HTC systems within the QGG, liasing with administrators of remote resources and also managing Access Grid and the Visualisation Resources.

## Services

- Provide accounts to local systems for researchers/staff/students
- Provide a central repository of software and manage licensing
- Provide a central knowledge base for users
- Available during business hours to provide timely help and support for all users
- Provide training for users
